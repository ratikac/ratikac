<h2><center> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h2></center>
<p>

I would like to introduce myself as a Data Scientist currently working for an agricultural startup in Bangalore, India. I love exploring different datasets and applying my knowledge of ML/DL/Statistics to make sense of the data and provide meaningful insights!

Fun fact about me - I had been working as a Quality Analyst before discovering my love for Analytics. It was a difficult transition given I had 5 years of QA experience but totally worth it 

Iâ€™m currently working on trying to predict the Volume of different SKUs ordered so that the sales can be better managed.
Would love to collaborate on different Analytical problems! Reach out to me if you would like to collaboarte or even just to say hi!

You can find me on [![LinkedIn][1.1]][1].
